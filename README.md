## ui :
**The UI design of Mars Express was established prior to my involvement in the project. When I took over the project after the departure of the previous developer, I continued to work within the existing UI framework and style guidelines. While I acknowledge that the current UI may not align with my personal preferences, I focused on maintaining consistency and adhering to the established design patterns while adding new components and features to the application.**
